your review were fine, but not very deep or critical. plots all can be improved (perhaps except the visualization of the Franch march to Russia we discussed in class!)

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

amabile
=======

the plot summarizes nicely the complex data space!

the roll over triggers some instability in the display

the color choices are not robust to color blindness and chelsea and brookly heights are hard to distinguish even for regular vision viewers


evans
=======

associating rage to color is always at risk of triggering preconceptions

labels too small

consider using more compact notation for large numbers, for example plot income in units of $1,000  and say that in the label

size of points unexplained

the three default dots in the legend should be changed to 1 as they are redundant

there is a lot of empty space in the plot. begin by removing empty space <0 on both axes, which is not meaningful anyways (no negative income)

yiningfan
=========

units missing in labels

tick labels too small

lines unexplained

color indistinguishable for the 10% of the male population that is color blind
